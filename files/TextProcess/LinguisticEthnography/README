===========================
1. INTRODUCTION

This is a (hopefully growing) package including computational linguistic tools to perform linguistic ethnography. That is, given a collection of documents that are representative for a certain phenomenon (e.g., happiness blogs; lies; women-authored texts; etc.), these tools can assist in analysing the collection and discovering potentially interesting patterns.

Two tools are currently included: 

1. EthnolingClasses, which determines the distribution and dominance score of a given set of semantic classes (e.g., affect classes; psychological LIWC classes).

2. EthnolingWords, which determines the distribution and dominance score of the Ngrams (sequences of N-words) in the collection.  


===========================
2. TERMINOLOGY AND BASIC REQUIREMENTS

The tools included in this package use the following terminology:

- FOREGROUND corpus: it refers to a collection of documents that are representative for the phenomenon to be modeled. For instance, the foreground corpus could be a collection of blogs labeled as "happy"; or, it could be a collection of deceptive statements; etc.

- BACKGROUND corpus: it refers to a collection of documents that are know to lack the phenomenon being modeled. This collection is used as a reference with respect to which we can determine significant, interesting patterns in the foreground corpus. For instance, the background corpus can consist of a collection of blogs labeled as "sad" (to be used as background when the foreground corpus consists of happy blogs); or, it can consist of a mixed collection of documents covering different domains, to form a neutral reference corpus. 

- DICTIONARY: a dictionary of classes, consisting of a list of words, with each word being connected to one or more semantic classes. A line in a dictionary follows the format:
  word,CLASS
Where word is a general word in the English lexicon, and CLASS is one of the semantic classes being represented in the dictionary. 
A word can belong to more than one class. A word can also include a wildcard (e.g., word*), in which case it will match all the occurrences that start with "word."

Dictionaries that are currently provided with this package include:
- LIWC (Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count) is a dictionary for psycholinguistic analysis, developed by James Pennebaker. It includes 2,200 words grouped into 70 broad categories.
- WordNet Affect is a resource that was created starting with WordNet, by annotating synsets with several emotions. We mainly use a subset that correponds to the six basic emotions: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. This subset includes 1,128 words grouped into 6 categories.
- Roget is a thesaurus of the English language, with words and phrases grouped into hierarchical classes. A word class usually includes synonyms, as well as other words that are semantically related. We use the publicly available version of Roget, which includes about 80,000 words, grouped into 1,000 categories.

3. HOW TO USE ETHNOLINGCLASSES

This tool determines the distribution and dominance score of a given set of semantic classes (i.e., classes of related words, such as JOY words, BELIEVE words, etc.). 

The tool requires a foreground corpus, a background corpus, and a dictionary. Other parameters may also be specified (see below). It then uses the formula introduced in (Mihalcea & Pulman, 2009), which determines the dominance score for each class, determined as the score of the class in the foreground corpus divided by the score of the same class in the background corpus. The score of a class is calculated as the number of occurrences of words from that class, divided by the total length of the corpus. See (Mihalcea & Pulman, 2009) for details. 

The output of this tool is a list of classes, along with their dominance scores. The words that "explain" a particular class can also be listed. 

To run the tool, type:

%perl EthnolingClasses.pl -fg <FOREGROUND> -bg <BACKGROUND> -dict <DICTIONARY> [-help] [-explain]

where: 
<FOREGROUND> is the main corpus used for analysis
<BACKGROUND> is the corpus used for reference (representing either the opposite phenomenon from the FOREGROUND, or a general purpose corpus)
<DICTIONARY> is the file containing the dictionary of classes. Each line in this file should have the format: word CLASS


Other options or parameters that can be specified:
 -help if present, it displays a help message
 -explain if present, it also shows the words found in the foreground corpus belonging to every single class
 -threshold <number> if present, it specifies the minimum number of words in a class for the class to be considered. The default value is 2. 


===========================

4. HOW TO USE ETHNOLINGWORDS

This tool determines the dominance score of the N-grams in a given corpus.

The tool requires a foreground corpus and a background corpus. Other parameters may also be specified (see below). It then calculates the dominance score of an N-gram, determined as the probability of the N-gram in the foreground corpus, divided by the probability of the N-gram in the background corpus. as the number of occurrences of the N-gram in the foreground corpus divided by the total number of occurrences in both the foreground and the background corpus. Add-one smoothing is used to avoid zero counts. This is similar to the method used in (Mihalcea and Liu, 2005) to determine dominant N-grams for a given corpus.  

The output of this tool is a list of N-grams, along with their dominance score. A dominance score much larger than 1 indicates an N-gram that is specific to the foreground corpus. A dominance score much smaller than 1 indicates an N-gram that is very rare in the foreground corpus (or, alternatively, an N-gram that is specific to the background corpus). A dominance score close to 1 indicates a "neutral" N-gram.

To run the tool, type:

%EthnolingWords.pl -fg <foregroundCorpus> -bg <backgroundCorpus [-ngram <sizeOfNgrams>] [-min <minimumThreshold>] [-help] 

where: 
<FOREGROUND> is the main corpus used for analysis
<BACKGROUND> is the corpus used for reference (representing either the opposite phenomenon from the FOREGROUND, or a general purpose corpus)


Other options or parameters that can be specified:
  -help if present, it displays a help message
  -ngram <sizeOfNgrams> if present, it indicates the length of the Ngrams to be considered. It has a default value of 1.
  -score <minimumThreshold> if present, it indicates the minimum threshold acceptable for the dominance score of an Ngram, such that the Ngram is considered. It has a default value of 2.
  -freq <minimumFrequency> if present, it indicates the minimum frequency inside the foregound corpus, acceptable for an Ngram such that the Ngram is considered. It has a default value of 10.
