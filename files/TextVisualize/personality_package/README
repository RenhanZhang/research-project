# Personality Package
# code to use trained weka models to make new predictions about the big 5 personality traits
# Steve Wilson, Summer 2015

Contents:
features.py  - library used for feature extraction
models/      - directory. contains a trained linear regression model for each of the big 5 personality traits
predict.sh   - example script that predicts the value of a data point in arff format
resources/   - directory. contains data sources needed by features.py
test.txt     - an example text file to use for demo purposes
text2arff.py - functions to convert plain text into feature vectors in arff format

Quick start guide:
# create an arff file from the text
 ./text2arff.py test.txt > test.arff
# since the sample code will just use 'target' as the name for the target variable,
#    change this to one of [ope, neu, agr, ext, con] depending on which personality
#    trait to predict, then choose the model accordingly. For example,
#    change target -> ope in the test.arff, then run
 ./predict.sh /home/public/weka-3-7-12/weka.jar functions.LinearRegression test.arff models/openness.linear-regression.model
